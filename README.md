HTML SPACE INC Webpage

This project is for educational purposes and is the result of my Codecademy project Company Home page with flexbox.

This site is made with HTML, CSS and a little JS. My goals for the design was to make a website for a fictional space exploration company.

The site is responsive with support for small devices up to large screens. navigation is through anchor tags with smooth scrolling around the site. photos are from unsplash and pexels repository.

all other information on the site is fictitious and not based off any actual company in business today, any likeness or similarities is purely out of coincidence.
